# Bahmni Clinic configuration and data.

### [![Bahmni Config](https://github.com/BahmniIndiaDistro/clinic-config/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BahmniIndiaDistro/clinic-config/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

This repo represents configuration for India Clinics.

### CI

Push to main would trigger gha. It does SSH into the
ec2 using the pem from repository secrets and perform git clone where the
clinic_config directory is volume mounted on bahmni-web and openmrs containers
as bahmni_config. Also a openmrs is restarted by docker.

This deploy_clinic_config.yml would deploy the latest config to clinic.bahmni-covid19.in environment.

This is currently a temporary CI solution - we would
eventually migrate to K8s once we move to India AWS account.
